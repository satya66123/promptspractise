## 2. AI Model (LLM) Comparison

Different **Large Language Models (LLMs)** or **AIs** will process these prompts with varying degrees of success based on their training and retrieval capabilities:

| Prompt Type | General-Purpose LLM (e.g., Standard GPT, Gemini) | Factual/Retrieval LLM (e.g., Google Search API integrated) | Creative/Finetuned LLM (e.g., Story-writing AI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1, P3, P8 (General/Creative)** | Excellent. Excels at tone and fluidity. | Good. Needs to filter out data to match the inspirational/general tone. | Best. Can generate highly emotional/engaging prose. |
| **P2, P4, P5, P7 (Structured/Data)** | Good, but may *hallucinate* statistics or generalise trends if specific data is not available in its internal training. | **Superior.** Can fetch up-to-date, verifiable statistics, employment rates, and policy details. **Essential for P7 (Data-Focused).** | Poor. Lacks the structured data retrieval and critical analysis required. |
| **P6 (Policy)** | Good. Can list known schemes (Mera Yuva Bharat, PMKVY). | Better. Can cross-reference scheme details, launch dates, and key objectives. | Not Applicable (Too factual). |
